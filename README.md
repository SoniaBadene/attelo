License (GPL-3)
---------------
Attelo is based on the Orange machine learning toolkit, which is
licensed under the GPL-3.

The Attelo components by themselves should be considered released
under the more liberal BSD3-like CeCILL-B license.  So long as
attelo depends on Orange, the combination should be considered as
GPL'ed however.

Aside from conformance with French law, the difference between the
CeCILL-B and other similarly liberal licenses is the strong citation
requirement mentioned in article 5.3.4 quoted below:

> Any Licensee who may distribute a Modified Software hereby expressly
> agrees to:
> 
>    1. indicate in the related documentation that it is based on the
>       Software licensed hereunder, and reproduce the intellectual
>       property notice for the Software,
> 
>    2. ensure that written indications of the Software intended use,
>       intellectual property notice and license hereunder are included in
>       easily accessible format from the Modified Software interface,
> 
>    3. mention, on a freely accessible website describing the Modified
>       Software, at least throughout the distribution term thereof, that
>       it is based on the Software licensed hereunder, and reproduce the
>       Software intellectual property notice,
> 
>    4. where it is distributed to a third party that may distribute a
>       Modified Software without having to make its source code
>       available, make its best efforts to ensure that said third party
>       agrees to comply with the obligations set forth in this Article .
> 
> If the Software, whether or not modified, is distributed with an
> External Module designed for use in connection with the Software, the
> Licensee shall submit said External Module to the foregoing obligations.
