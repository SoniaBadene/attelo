Evaluation with attelo report
=============================

The ``attelo report`` command generates a set of evaluation reports
by comparing ``attelo decode`` results against a gold standard. So
far it creates:

* global precision/recall reports
* confusion matrices

There are two ways to use attelo report.  You have it report scores
on a single predictions file (produced by `attelo decode`); or you
can have it report on a full set of predictions generated by a harness
over multiple folds.

Mode A: predictions file
------------------------

For one-off tests on `attelo decode` results, use the predictions
file mode (`--prediction <FILE>`).

(NB: if your test was on a particular fold of the data you can
also supply the `--fold` and `--fold-file` arguments to slice the
data)

Mode B: harness mode
--------------------

Harness-level reporting is only available programmatically
via the attelo API
