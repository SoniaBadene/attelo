===============

Attelo is mostly a parsing library with a couple of helper command
line tools on the side.

The bulk of attelo usage goes through the API. Below is an example showing
how you might run a simple attelo decoding cross-fold validation experiment
(This is `examples/mini_evaluate.py` in the attelo source
tree)

.. literalinclude:: ../example/mini_evaluate.py
   :language: python
