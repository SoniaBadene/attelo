Getting started
===============

You can either use attelo from the command line or the API,
We are gradually moving towards the API as the preferred
interface.  Below is an example showing how you might run
a simple attelo decoding cross-fold validation experiment
(This is `examples/mini_evaluate.py` in the attelo source
tree)

.. literalinclude:: ../example/mini_evaluate.py
   :language: python
